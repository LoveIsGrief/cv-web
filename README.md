CV-web
===============

A CV using HTML, AngularJS, Coffeescript and SASS.

Had to update my CV and was too "lazy" to update 3 parts of it,
 plus I wasn't really looking forward to doing so few years.
The prospect of writing a different CV for a different field is also nagging at me,
so that might also be included in this...

Prerequisites
--------------------
 - [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/#installation)
 - [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install)

How to use
--------------------

- Compile the coffeescript and sass files
- Open [CV.html](CV.html)

How to add your CV
--------------------

 - Copy an existing CV (michael.coffee for now) and replace the information in it.
 - Change CV.html to call `instantiate('<your CV filename without .js>')`
